# cs4550-project

Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to provide the user with player stats, item shop and news. It's essentially similar to a companion app, where everything you need about Fortnite, is in one single application. 

Player Stats:
The player stats will allow the user to search any player, but it will only return PlayStation stats.

Item Shop:
The item shop feature will allow users to view the current item shop. It will also update the item shop at 4PM pacific time everyday.

News:
The news will feature all of the news that is currently in the Fortnite announcements.
